# ghost detector on STM32F030R8-NUCLEO
Ghost detector with spirit box, emf detector, motion detector and negative ion detector. A great device for a hobbyist ghost hunter!

## Project Description
The project implements a ghost detector able to detect EMF changes, negative ion level and sweeps through FM frequencies seeking "ghost breaths". The device also provides a encoder radio station switching, potentiometer volume control and switch radio control. Level of electromagnetic field is showed on a led strip controlled by LM3914.
